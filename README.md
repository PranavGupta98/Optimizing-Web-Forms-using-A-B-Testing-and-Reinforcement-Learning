# Optimizing-Web-Forms-using-A-B-Testing-and-Reinforcement-Learning
This project aims to optimize survey forms to increase user engagement using design principles of HCI, conducting live randomized A/B testing and Reinforcement Learning.

Survey feedback forms are vital to obtain user feedback for a company to improve its services. However they often face resistance from users due to it being lengthy and tedious. In this project, a series of experiments are performed to test various approaches for optimizing the Web Forms and improving user experience. We incorporate design principles of HCI to develop web forms, conduct Randomized A/B Testing to gather data and apply Multi-armed Bandit algorithms to evaluate the likelihood of a user choosing to fill Form B over another Form A. The performance of the algorithms are then evaluated on the basis of regret and reward to find the most efficient algorithm confirming the hypothesis.

The repository consists of the code file and project report. The code is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook, the project report contains details of the project such as motivation, literature survey, algorithm explanation, user behaviour analysis, pseudo-code of algorithms, and in-depth results analysis.
